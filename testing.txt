To test the behaviour/appliance of el.x/el.y I now added circles to 0,0 as coord-marks of

1. symbol (0,0) red dot
2. linesG (0,0) green dot

I now can read values from svg and ts where only svg gets applied
As expected, the g moves with el

VERY STRANGE OBSERVATION:
Although I have got only ONE element, there is another pair of center dots 
in centerScreen.

I now set x = 100 on el in svg
And the el.x = 168 in index.ts, which gets read, but not applied.
Even if I remove the setting to 168, this dot is always there.

I already wondered ealier, why the elements are automatically center-screened,
even if NO coords are set at all.

But WHY are these circles appearing? I thought the symbol itself doesn't get displayed?
Did I somehow mix levels and created a redundant el?
I take the graphical el and create an object with the name of that, containing it...
That sounds actually wrong.
So I can only go on CONTENT of the graphical el, but not on itself.
THAT must be the reason, why the sim crashes when referring to el!
I create an itself containing object!
Does this explain the second pair of center marks?
