/**
 * What an overkill!!! :))))
 * I guess that could be done much more efficient (will try to), but was fun
 * Unfortunately most of the features I wanted to try in TS, esp decorators,
 * don't seem to wotk in this env.
 * This way, I find it extremly cumbersome.
 * Maybe I'll finally go without class but define just an interface for the "natural" els.
 * to define props.
 * /**
 * Originally planned to make an Interface here, but no modifications allowed
 * so I'd have to do that in each extending class separately.
 * That's why I go with an abstract class instead.
 */



//TODO difference interface vs type??
//TODO: extending class vs abstr class...

//TODO split all "special" features into extending classes, so only loaded, when used


//TODO default export
//TODO add rotate? on gLines?


//TODO 2.0 : where is really el needed in class?
//Can I detangle this and only have elements and creation in function?
// would this be meaningful?

//TODO el.x/y are CENTER of widget
// I fear el.x/y might be protected? But not sure. so I'll live with this:
//If x,y should be dynamic => no settings in css or svg!

//TODO x,y now workaround on groupTransform as nothing else seemed to worked on static elements
//There must be something wrong in calculating points or passing values. 
//If something is set in svg this approach only offsets. Don'like!!!
//CHECK MATHS!

//TODO how _recalc() could be splitted to only do the necessary calculations depending on caller

//TODO: switch to <Style> instead using el.style?

/**
 * as rotation is a groupTransform and x,y are also set on the g,
 * The settings on x,y in js/ts are the rotation center!!!
 * SVG x,y on use go directly on use!!!!
 */

/**
 * LIMITATIONS
 * I can't acces the the <use>s x,y from js/ts this way. Perhaps a question of type?
 * I actually don't understand or see the problem, but so the x,y in Polygon are actually only relative to the
 * x,y of the SVG element. so if you want to change them dynamically, don't set anything in svg/css as it doesn' get overwritten
 * but the values get added.

//TODO remove display from lines.style?
//TODO set strokeWidth on el on el.style?
//TODO simplyfy Polygon to static and add multiple extending modifications?
