# geometrix
A totally useless playfile with regular polygons
## work in progress
trying to get an idea how to structure using interfaces/classes/types  

![2022-04-20 12 36 21](polygon-widget.png)   

It now can be used as widget in TS, having 2 types:

**Polygon** : a regular Polygon;

**Spyrogon**: here you can change the connection between the polygon points to create regular geometric shapes with 3 to 12 vertices.

(...got some more TODOs on it ðŸ˜…)

## Creating a widget is just... 
COPY:
* the folder `polygon-widget` into your app-folder
* the file `polygon.defs` into your resources-folder

ADD CODE:
* import the widget in app/index.ts (Polygon and/or Spyrogon, depending on which you are going to use)

```js
import { createPolygon, Polygon, Spyrogon } from './polygon-widget/polygon-widget';
```
* add `polygon.defs` import in your `widgets.defs`



```js
<svg>
    <defs>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
        <link rel="import" href="/mnt/sysassets/system_widget.defs" />
        <link rel="import" href="polygon.defs" />
    </defs>
</svg>
```

* setting a `<use>` in `index.view` like the following example
```js
<use id="anyId" href="#polygon-widget"  x="168" y="168" opacity = "1"/>
```
* and then instantiate your poly in `app/index.ts` like:

``` js
let anyName = createPolygon(0, document.getElementById('anyId')) as Polygon;
let anyOtherName = createPolygon(1, document.getElementById('anyOtherId')) as Spyrogon;
```
This will create shapes with the default values:
* radius = 100;
* points = 5;
* strokeWidth = 2;
* next = 1;

To choose custom values you can add these attributes like:

```js
let poly1 = createPolygon(0, document.getElementById('poly1'),120, 12, 10) as Polygon
```
or for the Spyrogon like:
```js
let spyro1 = createPolygon(1, document.getElementById('spyro1'),150, 8, 4, 3) as Spyrogon
```
The additional value here defines the next point ( so line0 goes from p0 to p3, line1 from p1 to p4...)

### Settings on `<use>`in index.view or styles.css
* x
* y
* style (opacity, fill, display)
<h2>Dynamic settings in TS:<h2>
<details><summary> </summary><blockquote>


Element:
* radius 
* points
* strokeWidth
* next
* style 
    * fill
    * opacity
    * display
* rotate
* scale
    * x
    * y
* x
* y
* lines[index]
   * style 
        * fill
        * opacity
        * display
        * strokeWidth 
              
to vary the appearance.
</blockquote></details>


### Different to usual use:
* `x` and  `y` are currently a groupTransform, so an **offset** to your settings in css/svg.
* `strokeWidth` can be set directly on element!
* `next` defines the +x point to wich to connect to.
* `rotate` is set directly on element. the value is rotate.angle.  

* `lines` is an array of the lines, building the Polygon.

   So the settings of `style` on lines need to be done withe a el.lines.forEach for all or a group of lines.
   
   for a single line as el.lines[index]

### ...and a huge THANKS!
to Gondwana from [Gondwanasoft](https://github.com/gondwanasoft) who helped me to understand OOP in JS a bit better, while working on the fitbit-3D-text project. This encouraged me to try something in TS (Not that I know, what I'm doing!).

He now built a [fitbit-widget-template](https://github.com/gondwanasoft/fitbit-widget-template) based on the approach in JS.

Any ideas or critcism would be highly appreciated! I just tried, what I thought might work. But I'm totally convinced there will be much better solutions...
