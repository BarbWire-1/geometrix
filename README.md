## work in progress:
Playfile to get an idea how to structure using interfaces/classes/types


### dynamically:
* 3 to 12 vertices,
* size of circle,
* number of points,
* connection between points (next point),
* fills perline/ fill-themes (1 to ... get applied per %points)
working now for a single object (class) now *somehow* .

As novice to this, I'd be happy for any ideas... so please feel invited üòÅ
