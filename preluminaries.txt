AIM:
Create a simply reusable PolygonElement

The polygon gets created by calculating 3 up to 12 points
regularly arranged on a circle.

abstract Settings:
private: Point
centerX
centerY

populated:
    radius,
    number of points,
    strokeWidth (used to adjust radius to fit the poly inside the abstract circle)
    
methods:
privte:
    calcPoints
    length
    gradient(?) (to calc points depending on progress)
populated:    
    connectTo (defines sequence in which points get connected )
 

class Point,  
interface incl. all optional,

partial types:
    class1: abstract calculations
    class2: results class1 + connection to lines
    
how to handle style?
(allow fill on each line or only full poly? 
evt both by exposing all lines but 'inherit' as pre?)


OR GO WITH ROTATED LINES INSTEAD?
(would need <g>s in symbol, but much less calculation)
